# SitecoreAI Apps
The SitecoreAI Apps code repository is a collection of useful Marketplace applications designed to extend and customise your SitecoreAI experience and functionality.

## Traffic Light
The first custom app featured here is Traffic Light. Because the Cloud Portal URL is the same across all environments, editors often want a clear visual indication of which environment they are operating in and an extra prompt when editing live content.
The Traffic Light app addresses this need by displaying a visual signal within the Page Builder to show the current environment. It also offers context-specific actions helping editors understand what actions are permitted in each environment. Read more [here](/traffic-light/README.md).
